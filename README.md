# Planned coding challenge: Memory lane

### Problem definition

After a series of discovery calls we found out a problem that our users are facing. They are having a hard time sharing their memories with friends and family. They are using a combination of social media, messaging apps, and email to share their memories. They are looking for a solution that allows them to store and share their memories in a single place.

As a first iteration for this solution, we want to build a web application that allows users to create a memory lane and share it with friends and family. A memory lane is a collection of events that happened in a chronological order. Each event consists of a title, a description, a timestamp, and at least one image.

## Instructions

GMAIL ACCOUNT REQUIRED

- Fill up the env value with your own (or the one I shared by email)
-  Open a terminal
-  `npm i`.
- `npm run dev`.
- Open a second terminal
- `npm run serve:api`.
- Enjoy ! Ideally to test all functionalities, you should have two Gmail Accounts, open one private and one public broswing tab conenct your gmail account to each tab respectively and test the app on both accounts.
